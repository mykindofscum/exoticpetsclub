A web app where users with exotic and mythical animals form a community. People can list their animals for sale, hangout with dragons or have play with other exotic animals. Sometimes people get bored of drawing on their pet turtle's shell or they're tired of their cave troll smashing up their backyard. Pictures, descriptions, contact info and price are some of the data required in the posts. Users have to login in order to post, edit and delete posts. Users contact other users through email if they are interested in buying a pet.
